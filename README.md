# Kantu

Kantu (rhymes with "onto") is a programming language for writing programs that Run Correctlyâ„¢.

- Secure by default--no file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly enabled
- Memory safe
- No runtime exceptions
- Guaranteed termination (no infinite loops/recursion)
- Arbitrary preconditions and postconditions can be checked at compile-time

In technical terms, some of Kantu's prominent features include [dependent types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type), [pureness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming), and [totality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_functional_programming).
