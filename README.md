# Pamlihu

A simple programming language that supports dependent types.

## Pronunciation

In practice, "pom-LEE-hoo" is good enough.
In this case, the syllables would rhyme with "mom", "glee", and "who", respectively.
The second syllable is emphasized (which is why "LEE" is written in all capital letters).

Officially, any valid [Lojbanic pronunciation](https://lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_xhtml-section-chunks/section-basic-phonetics.html) is correct.
For example, /pamËˆlihu/ (IPA).

The name is derived from the Lojbanic word _pamli'u_, which roughly
means "to go on a date".
