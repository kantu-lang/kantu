# Pamlihu

A simple programming language that supports dependent types.

## Pronunciation

Official: /pamËˆlihu/ (IPA).

In practice, English speakers such as myself will often say something closer "pahm-lee-who",
where "pahm" pronounced like "palm" without the "l",
"lee" is pronounced like the name (i.e., rhymes with "tree"),
and "who" is pronounced normally.

The name is derived from the Lojbanic word _pamli'u_, which roughly
means "to date" (in the sense of "We went on our first date last week.").
