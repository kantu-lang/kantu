# Pamlihu

A simple programming language that supports dependent types.

## Pronunciation

Official: /pamËˆlihu/ (IPA).

In practice, English speakers such as myself will often say something closer "pom-lee-hoo"
(i.e., the syllables rhyme with "mom", "glee", and "who", respectively).

The name is derived from the Lojbanic word _pamli'u_, which roughly
means "to go on a date".
