# Kantu

A simple programming language that supports dependent types.

## Pronunciation

In practice, "CON-too" (rhymes with "gone too") is good enough.

Officially, any valid [Lojbanic pronunciation](https://lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_xhtml-section-chunks/section-basic-phonetics.html) is correct.
For example, /Ëˆkantu/ (IPA).

The name is derived from the Lojbanic word _kantu_, which roughly
means "quantum" or "elementary particle".
